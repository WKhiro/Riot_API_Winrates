# Riot API Win Rates

A project in which I want to use the data queried from Riot Games' API in order to generate winrates for a summoner's requested champion. The ordering of my goals is as follows:

### Query the champion that a summoner was playing in multiple games
### Query if they won or lost
### Calculate the win rate

# Future features?

I also want to calculate their win ratios against specific opponents (basically see who they beat or lose to the most)
